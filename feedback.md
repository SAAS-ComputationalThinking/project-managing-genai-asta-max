This is really cool! It's essentially a playable game with a few bugs that you already pointed out to me.

 * If a player makes an invalid move, they lose their turn.  Maybe there could be an error message?
 * There's no mechanism for double jumps
 * What should happen at the end of the game?

How well do you feel you understand the code at this point?  What would it take to be at the point where you would know what to do to add features or to correct bugs?
